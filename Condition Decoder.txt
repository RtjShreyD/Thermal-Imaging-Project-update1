S+R con1   ---> try(measureneck =or-15 )catch(realmeasureneck +or-15)
S+R con2   ---> try(realmeasureneck +or-15)catch(measureneck =or-15 )
 correction +or-15 has been applied from now on every neck alg.
S+R con3+4   ---> try(mean of realmeasureneck and measureneck)catch(decide which of the two is not working and use the other one like if realmeasureneck not working use measureneck)

NeckCalc ConA,B   --->try(mean of S+Rcon3 and NeckCalc)....mentiontioned in a separate notepad doc named  as......NeckCalcCons


%neck = min(neck2,neck3);    %%for NeckCalc-1
%neck = max(neck2,neck3);    %%for NeckCalc-2
neckx = (neck2 + neck3)/2;    %%for NeckCalc-3  this is used as neck measurement for this condition
necky = min(neck2,neck3); 
neck = (neckx + necky)/2;     %%for NeckCalc-4    %%finalised NeckCalc-4

Finally  NeckCalc2() is used and consists of NeckCalc-4 conB S+R con3+4.


newhipfront()---> new function for hip in front image
new_right_points()---> original
new_right_points2()---> used newhipfront() in this in try and catch is old method for hip
new_right_points3()---> Condition used here is both old and new method for hip is used ps(5,1,1) is calc by newhipfront and added point ps(8,1,1)  is calc by old hip method.
the new_right_points3() also uses a another function named measurehip2() outside in the main code that calc the hip value using both ps(5,1) and ps(8,1) and takes max of both as the final value.
 Using max of both as the final value is --->ConA
 Using avg of both as the final value is --->ConB
 Using max plus diff of max and min---->ConC
    minn=min(l,d);
    maxx=max(l,d);
    diff=maxx-minn;
    h=maxx+diff;   
Using max plus diff of avg of max,min to max--->Con.D
    avg=(maxx+minn)/2;
    diff=maxx-avg;
    h=maxx+diff;    
Using CONA+B+C+D+minn/5 as CON.E

Similar will be for new-leftpts()

measurestomach()-2%correction applied			%%%Till here neck is  16/25, hip is 17/25, stomach is 17/25. on 26/8/2018.

Moving from stomach to muscles(biceps) carrying forward the previous used conditions for neck,hip, stomach..................

muscle()-orginal	---->the original function, many changes have been made in it however its recovery method is removing correection and using trd and trdr as the  axis for measurement, also listed in thefunction itself
muscle()-correction applied  ---> presently using +-5, from here it is finalised so will be applied in every muscle() function, make it understood even if not mentioned
muscle()-min(d1,d2)  --->d1,d2 are for left and right sides respectively
muscle()-max(d1,d2)  		
muscle()-avg(d1,d2)

muscl() CON. A --->min(old bicep measurement, new bicep measurement)	
muscl() CON. B --->max(old bicep measurement, new bicep measurement)
muscl() CON. C --->avg(old bicep measurement, new bicep measurement)
